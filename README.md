# TDAR

## General
This game was created with Unit 5.0.1, my programming skills and the amazing Unity Assets Store, the majority of assets in the game were downloaded for free from this store.
Last Sentinel (Original name TDAR) is a game created in one week. I wanted to develop a "complete" game it in a few days, through for all phases (Idea, Design, Develop, Publish, etc). Besides that, I wanted to test some plugins to manage ads and rankings in Google Play.
